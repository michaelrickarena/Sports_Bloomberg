      <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

      <p>Last updated: 2024-04-02</p>

      <p>
        At 16877214 Canada Inc. (&quot;[Company]&quot;) we are committed to
        maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality and security of your personal
        information. We have developed this Privacy Policy to describe our
        privacy policies and practices and how we collect, use and disclose the
        personal information of those individuals who visit our website.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy Policy Effective for Canada</h2>
      <p>
        It is our policy to comply with the privacy legislation within each
        jurisdiction in which we operate. Sometimes the privacy legislation
        and/or an individual&apos;s right to privacy are different from one
        jurisdiction to another. This Privacy Policy covers only those
        activities that are subject to the provisions of Canada&apos;s federal
        and provincial privacy laws, as applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy has a limited scope and application. Consequently,
        the rights and obligations contained in this Privacy Policy may not be
        available to all individuals or in all jurisdictions.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
      <p>
        For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, personal information is any
        information about an identifiable individual, other than the
        person&apos;s business title or business contact information when used
        or disclosed for the purpose of business communications.
      </p>

      <h2>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h2>
      <p>
        You can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing
        any information about yourself, including your e-mail address. Our web
        server may collect information related to your visit to our website,
        including the IP address and domain used to access our website, the type
        and version of your browser, the website you came from to access our
        website, the page you entered and exited at, any website page that is
        viewed by that IP address and what country you are from. We use this
        information to monitor our website&apos;s performance (such as number of
        visits, average time spent, page views) and for our business purposes
        such as working to continually upgrade our website.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect and maintain different types of personal information in
        respect of the individuals with whom we interact. This includes contact
        and identification information, such as your name and e-mail address,
        and any payment information provided in connection with a user&apos;s
        subscription.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you request information from us, we may use the contact
        information that you provide to send you information relating to your
        request.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also collect market-related information, which may include
        personal information, concerning market trends and activities impacting
        our business. This information may include contract terms, financial
        information and other information for the purpose of market analysis and
        strategic planning. We may also collect information related to our
        media, investor and public relations activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general rule, 16877214 Canada Inc. collects personal information
        directly from you. In most circumstances where the personal information
        that we collect about you is held by a third party, we will obtain your
        permission before we seek out this information from such sources (such
        permission may be given directly by you, or implied from your actions).
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, we may use the services of third parties in our
        business and may also receive personal information collected by those
        third parties in the course of the performance of their services for us
        or otherwise. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable steps to
        ensure that such third parties have represented to us that they have the
        right to disclose your personal information to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory
        requirements, we may collect information about you without your
        knowledge or consent.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Do We Collect Personal Information?</h2>
      <p>
        We collect personal information to enable us to manage, maintain, and
        develop our business and operations, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          to establish, maintain and manage our relationship with you so that we
          may provide you with, or receive from you, the products and services
          that have been requested;
        </li>
        <li>
          to be able to review the products and services that we provide to you
          so that we may understand your requirements for our products and
          services and so that we may work to improve our products and services;
        </li>
        <li>
          to protect us against error, fraud, theft and damage to our goods and
          property;
        </li>
        <li>
          to enable us to comply with applicable law or regulatory requirements;
          and
        </li>
        <li>any other purpose to which you consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Do We Use Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        When you visit the website, we place a &quot;cookie&quot; on the hard
        drive of your computer to track your visit. A cookie is a small data
        file that is transferred to your hard drive through your web browser
        that can only be read by the website that placed the cookie on your hard
        drive. The cookie acts as an identification card and allows our website
        to identify you and to record your passwords and preferences. The cookie
        allows us to track your visit to the website so that we can better
        understand your use of our website so that we can customize and tailor
        the website to better meet your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, on most web
        browsers you may change this setting to have your web browser either:
        (1) notify you prior to a website placing a cookie on your hard drive so
        that you can decide whether or not to accept the cookie; or (2)
        automatically prevent the placing of a cookie on your hard drive. It
        should be noted that if cookies are not accepted, you will not be able
        to access a number of web pages found on the website.
      </p>

      <h2>What about Links to Other Websites?</h2>
      <p>
        Our website may contain links to other websites that may be subject to
        less stringent privacy standards. We cannot assume any responsibility
        for the privacy practices, policies or actions of the third parties that
        operate these websites. 16877214 Canada Inc. is not responsible for how
        such third parties collect, use or disclose your personal information.
        You should review the privacy policies of these websites before
        providing them with personal information.
      </p>

      <h2>How Do We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information?</h2>
      <p>We may use and disclose your personal information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy; or</li>
        <li>
          for any additional purposes for which we have obtained your consent to
          use or disclose your personal information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may use or disclose your personal information without your knowledge
        or consent where we are permitted or required by applicable law to do
        so.
      </p>

      <h2>When Do We Disclose Your Personal Information?</h2>
      <p>
        The personal information we collect is used and disclosed for our
        business purposes, including for those purposes explained in this
        Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may share your personal information with our employees, contractors,
        consultants, affiliates and other parties who require such information
        to assist us with managing our relationship with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may disclose your information to third parties, including: third
        parties that provide services to us or on our behalf; third parties that
        assist 16877214 Canada Inc. in the provision of services to you; and
        third parties whose services we use to conduct our business.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, servers used with CockroachDB (N. Virginia, USA), Render
        (Oregon, USA), Vercel (California, USA) may provide certain information
        technology and data processing services to us from time to time so that
        we may operate our business, and as result, your personal information
        may be collected, used, processed, stored or disclosed in Canada, and
        the United States of America. In these circumstances, the governments,
        courts, law enforcement, national security, or regulatory agencies of
        such other jurisdictions may be able to obtain access to your personal
        information through the laws of the foreign country.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, personal information may be disclosed or transferred to
        another party during the course of, or completion of, a change in
        ownership of or the grant of a security interest in, all or a part of
        16877214 Canada Inc through, for example, an asset or share sale, or
        some other form of business combination, merger or joint venture,
        provided that such party is bound by appropriate agreements or
        obligations and required to use or disclose your personal information in
        a manner consistent with the use and disclosure provisions of this
        Privacy Policy, unless you consent otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>Further, your personal information may be disclosed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          as permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements;
        </li>
        <li>
          to comply with valid legal processes such as search warrants,
          subpoenas or court orders;
        </li>
        <li>to protect the rights and property of 16877214 Canada Inc.</li>
        <li>
          during emergency situations or where necessary to protect the safety
          of a person or group of persons;
        </li>
        <li>where the personal information is publicly available; or</li>
        <li>with your consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Your Consent is Important to Us</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to us that we collect, use or disclose your personal
        information where we have your consent to do so. Depending on the
        sensitivity of the personal information, your consent may be implied,
        deemed (using an opt-out mechanism) or express. Express consent can be
        given orally, electronically or in writing. Implied consent is consent
        that can reasonably be inferred from your action or inaction. For
        example, when you enter into an agreement with us, we will assume your
        consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal
        information for purposes related to the performance of that agreement
        and for any other purposes identified to you at the relevant time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, we will seek your consent at the time that we collect your
        personal information. In certain circumstances, your consent may be
        obtained after collection but prior to our use or disclosure of your
        personal information. If we plan to use or disclose your personal
        information for a purpose not previously identified (either in this
        Privacy Policy or separately), we will endeavor to advise you of that
        purpose before such use or disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we have described above, we may collect, use or disclose your
        personal information without your knowledge or consent where we are
        permitted or required to do so by applicable law or regulatory
        requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>Choice/Opt-Out</h2>
      <p>
        You may change or withdraw your consent at any time, subject to legal or
        contractual obligations and reasonable notice, by contacting our Privacy
        Officer using the contact information set out below. In some
        circumstances, a change in or withdrawal of consent may severely limit
        our ability to provide products or services to, or acquire products or
        services from, you. All communications with respect to such withdrawal
        or variation of consent should be in writing and addressed to our
        Privacy Officer.
      </p>
      <p>
        We assume that, unless you advise us otherwise, that you have consented
        to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as
        explained in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>

      <h2>How is Your Personal Information Protected?</h2>
      <p>
        16877214 Canada Inc. endeavors to maintain technical and procedural
        safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal
        information in question. These safeguards are designed to prevent your
        personal information from loss and unauthorized access, copying, use,
        modification or disclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
        to be 100% secure. As a result, while this website strives to protect
        your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any
        information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once
        this website receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable
        efforts to ensure its security on our systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The security of your personal information is important to us, please
        advise our Privacy Officer immediately of any incident involving the
        loss of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal information
        that is in our custody or control.
      </p>

      <h2>Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        It is important that the information contained in our records is both
        accurate and current. If your personal information happens to change
        during the course of our relationship, please keep us informed of such
        changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some circumstances we may not agree with your request to change your
        personal information and will instead append an alternative text to the
        record in question.
      </p>

      <h2>Access to Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        You can ask to see the personal information that we hold about you. If
        you want to review, verify or correct your personal information, please
        contact our Privacy Officer using the contact information set out below.
        Please note that any such communication must be in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When requesting access to your personal information, please note that we
        may request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your
        identity and right to access, as well as to search for and provide you
        with the personal information that we hold about you. We may charge you
        a fee to access your personal information; however, we will advise you
        of any fee in advance. If you require assistance in preparing your
        request, please contact the office of our Privacy Officer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your right to access the personal information that we hold about you is
        not absolute. There are instances where applicable law allows or
        requires us to refuse to provide some or all of the personal information
        that we hold about you. In addition, the personal information may have
        been destroyed, erased or made anonymous in accordance with our record
        retention obligations and practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the event that we cannot provide you with access to your personal
        information, we will endeavor to inform you of the reasons why, subject
        to applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>Inquiries or Concerns?</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or concerns about
        how we manage your personal information, please contact our Privacy
        Officer by e-mail. We will endeavor to answer your questions and advise
        you of any steps taken to address the issues raised by you. If you are
        dissatisfied with our response, you may be entitled to make a written
        submission to the Privacy Commissioner in your jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <p>
        From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Policy to reflect
        changes in our legal or regulatory obligations or in the manner in which
        we deal with your personal information. We will post any revised version
        of this Privacy Policy on our website www.thesmartlines.com/privacy and
        we encourage you to refer back to it on a regular basis. This Privacy
        Policy was last updated on the date provided above.

      <h2>Interpretation of this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Any interpretation associated with this Privacy Policy will be made by
        our Privacy Officer. This Privacy Policy includes examples but is not
        intended to be restricted in its application to such examples, therefore
        where the word &quot;including&quot; is used, it shall mean
        &quot;including without limitation.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy does not impose upon 16877214 Canada Inc. any
        obligations, or create or confer upon any individual any rights, outside
        of, or in addition to, those imposed by Canada&apos;s federal and
        provincial privacy laws, as applicable. Should there be, in a specific
        case, any inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and Canada&apos;s
        federal and provincial privacy laws, as applicable, this Privacy Policy
        shall be interpreted, in respect of that case, to give effect to, and
        comply with, such privacy laws.
