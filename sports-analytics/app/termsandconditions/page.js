        use of the Site, including, but not limited to, third-party sites, any
        use of the Site&apos;s content, other than as expressly authorized in
        these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
      <p>
        All content, trademarks, logos, and intellectual property on the Site
        are owned by or licensed to the Site. You are granted a limited,
        non-exclusive license to access and use the Site solely for your
        personal, non-commercial purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>17. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        Your use of the Site is governed by our Privacy Policy, which explains
        how we collect, use, and protect your personal information. By using the
        Site, you consent to our data practices as described therein. A copy of
        the Privacy Policy can be found on the Site.
      </p>

      <h2>18. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed by and construed, interpreted and enforced
        in accordance with the laws of the province of Ontario and the federal
        laws of Canada applicable therein.
      </p>

      <h2>19. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        19.1 <strong>Arbitration:</strong> Any dispute, claim, or controversy
        between you and us arising in connection with, or relating in any way
        to, these Terms (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
        misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims
        arise during or after the termination or expiration of these Terms) will
        be determined solely by mandatory binding arbitration. In arbitration
        there is no judge or jury and court review of an arbitration award is
        limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the
        same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory
        relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of these Terms as
        a court would.
      </p>
      <p>
        19.2 <strong>Exception:</strong> Notwithstanding clause 19.1 above, you
        and the Corporation both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to
        waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time,
        to seek injunctive relief in a court of law. In addition to the above,
        notwithstanding clause 19.1 above, the Corporation may file a suit in a
        court of law against you to address intellectual property infringement
        claims.
      </p>

      <h2>20. Waiver</h2>
      <p>
        Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, no failure to exercise, or
        delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from
        these Terms operates, or may be construed, as a waiver thereof; and no
        single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege
        hereunder precludes any other or further exercise thereof or the
        exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
      </p>

      <h2>21. Severability</h2>
      <p>
        If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal or
        unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
        unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of these
        Terms or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in
        any other jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>22. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the
        Corporation regarding your use of the Site, superseding any prior
        agreements or understandings, whether oral or written.
      </p>

      <h2>23. Force Majeure</h2>
      <p>
        The Corporation, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or their
        respective directors, officers, employees, or successors shall not be
        liable for any failure or delay in performance due to events beyond its
        reasonable control, including natural disasters, war, or other
        unforeseen events.
